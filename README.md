# Website-Design-Task-2
 This website is a code I created for the Task 2 of the units Web Design. It is made for my friend who wants to start a 3D Modelling, Printing, and painting business. She has a passion for 3D printing and wishes to someday turn her hobby into her career. I created this so she can get more recognition.
